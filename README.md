I am passionate about writing, editing, and design. As a highly passionate, driven, and detail-oriented technical writer with ten years of experience, I excel in both IT and manufacturing environments. I have a proven track record of successfully leading documentation projects, implementing efficient single-source content management strategies, and leveraging docs-as-code methodologies to streamline workflows and improve content delivery. My expertise lies in transforming complex technical information into clear, concise, and user-friendly documentation that meets the needs of diverse audiences.

I am a Senior Product Owner and Documentation Strategist with over a decade of experience bridging the gap between complex engineering and user-centric solutions. Throughout my career, I have treated documentation and internal systems as products—managing their entire lifecycle, from gathering requirements with engineering and DevOps to delivering high-impact solutions for thousands of users.

My background is unique because I combine technical administration with strategic leadership. I am a certified Salesforce and Conga Administrator who has successfully implemented scalable solutions that improved business process efficiency by 40% and accelerated development cycles by 20%. I don't just document roadmaps; I design them.

In my recent roles at Stored Energy Systems and Trimble, I have been deeply embedded in Agile SCRUM and SAFE environments. I’ve led cross-functional teams to reduce delivery times by 30% and authored the governance standards that improved overall team efficiency by 40%. I am passionate about using data and stakeholder feedback to turn technical complexity into a seamless, high-value user experience.
