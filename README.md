# Technical Writing Portfolio

## Professional Overview
I am a Lead Technical Writer and Documentation Product Owner with over a decade of experience driving content strategy across industrial power systems, enterprise IT, and SaaS ecosystems. I specialize in transforming complex technical workflows—ranging from REST APIs and Docs-as-Code methodologies to mission-critical hardware specifications—into scalable, high-impact documentation.

As a strategic bridge between engineering, marketing, and legal teams, I don’t just document products; I own the documentation lifecycle. From architecting Jekyll and MadCap Flare environments to designing product roadmaps and prototypes, I ensure that technical content serves as a strategic asset that accelerates user adoption and meets rigorous industry standards.
