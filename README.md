# Technical Writing Portfolio

## Professional Overview
I am a senior technical writer and product specialist with over a decade of experience across the Salesforce/Conga ecosystems, industrial power systems, and enterprise IT services. My expertise lies in translating complex enterprise workflows—from REST APIs and "Docs-as-Code" methodologies to mission-critical hardware specifications—into clear, actionable documentation.

I bridge the gap between technical engineering and business value, ensuring that documentation serves as a strategic asset for developers, end-users, and stakeholders alike.
