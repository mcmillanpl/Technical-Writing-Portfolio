# Pamela McMillan | Senior Product Owner & Documentation Strategist

I am a Senior Product Owner and Documentation Strategist with over a decade of experience bridging the gap between complex engineering and user-centric solutions. Throughout my career, I have treated documentation and internal systems as products—managing their entire lifecycle, from gathering requirements with engineering and DevOps to delivering high-impact solutions for thousands of users.

My background is unique because I combine technical administration with strategic leadership. I am a certified Salesforce and Conga Administrator who has successfully implemented scalable solutions that improved business process efficiency by 40% and accelerated development cycles by 20%. I don't just document roadmaps; I design them.

In my recent roles at Stored Energy Systems and Trimble, I have been deeply embedded in Agile SCRUM and SAFE environments. I’ve led cross-functional teams to reduce delivery times by 30% and authored the governance standards that improved overall team efficiency by 40%. I am passionate about using data and stakeholder feedback to turn technical complexity into a seamless, high-value user experience.

### Why a Product Owner?

* **Managed Lifecycles:** Owned end-to-end documentation for 20+ product lines.
* **Optimized Systems:** Implemented Salesforce and Conga solutions that improved contract efficiency by 60%.
* **Led Teams:** Directed 5+ cross-functional teams to reduce delivery times by 30%.
