# Technical Writing Portfolio

## Professional Overview
I am a senior technical writer and product specialist with over a decade of experience within the Salesforce and Conga ecosystems. My expertise lies in translating complex enterprise workflows—specifically Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) and automated document generation—into clear, actionable technical documentation.

I advocate for a "Docs-as-Code" approach, utilizing Markdown and Git-based workflows to ensure documentation evolves at the same pace as the product.

## Technical Documentation Samples
The following samples represent a strategic API suite for a contract generation platform. Each document is designed to address specific developer requirements while maintaining alignment with business governance standards.

* **[User Access API](./API/user-access-api.md)**: Documentation for managing license provisioning and auditing user permissions across Salesforce and Conga environments.
* **[Webhook Subscription API](./API/webhook-api.md)**: A guide for configuring real-time event notifications to synchronize document signing statuses with external systems.
* **[Salesforce Query Service](./API/send-query.md)**: Technical reference for executing SOQL queries via REST to retrieve dynamic record data.
* **[Salesforce Pull Request API](./API/pull-request.md)**: Specifications for initiating and monitoring data synchronization between CRM records and document engines.
