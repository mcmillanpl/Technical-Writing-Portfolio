# Writing portfolio
This repository contains samples of my technical writing. I am passionate about writing, editing, and design. I strive in stressful and highly paced environments and always maintain a positive and friendly demeanor to promote a healthy work atmosphere. My greatest strengths lie in my project management, efficiency, ability to handle high capacity work loads, and time management skills.

Besides having almost a decade of technical writing experience, I am also certified as a Salesforce Admin, in Conga Composer, Conga Contracts for Salesforce, and CongaSign.
