# Create a project in MadCap Flare
In Flare, a project refers to a collection of files and resources that are used to create and manage a specific output, such as a documentation set or an online help system. It includes various components like topics, stylesheets, images, and configuration files, enabling users to organize, author, and publish their content in a structured and efficient manner.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following:

- MadCap Flare installed.
- Microsoft Windows 10 or later
- Microsoft .NET Framework v4.8 or later
- [Ghostscript](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/ghostscript64.aspx) (This is a free application that Flare uses to handle PDF/ESP files)

## Create a new project
1. Select **New Project** from the Start Page.
   - You can also select the **File** tab from the top ribbon, then select the **New Project** option.
2. Populate the empty fields of the Start New Project Wizard window, then select **Next**.
   - **Project name**: the name of the project.
   - **Project folder**: indicates the default location for the project.
   - **Language**: primary language for the project.
   - **Bind to Source Control**: optional feature, which will allow you to integrate the new project with a source control application. For more information on this optional feature, refer to the Bind to Source Control article.
3. Choose a project template, select **Next**.
   - **New from template**: choose a factory file as a starting point. You can also select you own custom template file by expanding the appropriate folder and choosing the template file you want.
   - **New from existing**: this option allows you to use an existing project as a basis for a new project.
   - **New from import**: import legacy files (ex. Word, Excel, Framemaker) to base a project on.
4. Depending on the template chosen, you may be prompted to select colors, font, and a logo to apply to your project. These optios can be changed later in the Branding Editor. Select **Next**.
5. Choose the primary target, select **Finish**.
   - In MadCap Flare, targets are a single instance of an output type. These targets can include HTML, PDF, Word, and ePub. A target file is used for each instance of an output type. And you can have many targets in your project. You can always change the primary target later.

Now that your project is created, you can begin adding content and features.
