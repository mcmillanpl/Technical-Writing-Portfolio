# Create a project in MadCap Flare
In Flare, a project refers to a collection of files and resources that are used to create and manage a specific output, such as a documentation set or an online help system. It includes various components like topics, stylesheets, images, and configuration files, enabling users to organize, author, and publish their content in a structured and efficient manner.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following:

- Have MadCap Flare installed on your computer.
- Microsoft Windows 10 or later
- Microsoft .NET Framework v4.8 or later
- [Ghostscript](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/ghostscript64.aspx) (This is a free application that Flare uses to handle PDF/ESP files)
