# User Education & Tutorials

This section demonstrates the ability to document complex software workflows and development environments. These guides focus on "Docs-as-Code" methodology and advanced programming concepts, providing clear paths for both technical writers and developers.

## MadCap Flare & Git Version Control
A series of technical SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for managing documentation lifecycles within a collaborative development environment.

* **[Connecting MadCap Flare to GitHub](./connect-madcap-github.md)**: A step-by-step guide for establishing secure SSH/HTTPS connections between Flare and remote repositories.
* **[Source Control Binding](./madcap-bind-to-source-control.md)**: Best practices for binding projects to Git, ensuring clean commit histories and conflict resolution.
* **[Importing Projects to Git](./import-existing-madcap-to-git.md)**: Instructions for migrating legacy local projects into a distributed version control system.
* **[Creating New Projects](./create-a-project-in-madcap.md)**: Standardizing project templates and folder structures for team-wide consistency.

## Programming & Development
Focused educational content for software engineers and developers working with the .NET ecosystem.

* **[Advanced Operations on Numbers in C#](./advanced-operations-on-numbers-in-C#.md)**: A deep dive into numerical precision, bitwise operations, and performance optimization in C#.
* **Focus**: Translating abstract mathematical programming concepts into practical, readable code samples and explanations.

## Documentation Standards
All tutorials in this folder are built with a focus on developer experience (DX) and process scalability:
* **Docs-as-Code**: Demonstrating the integration of professional authoring tools (MadCap Flare) with developer workflows (GitHub).
* **Step-Oriented Instruction**: Every guide utilizes a "Goal-Action-Result" structure to ensure users can verify their progress at every stage.
* **Technical Accuracy**: Code-heavy tutorials are vetted for syntax accuracy and follow industry-standard naming conventions.
